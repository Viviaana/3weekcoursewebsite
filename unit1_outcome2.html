    <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3>
    <p> Throughout the project I’ve continued using Trello to organise what needs to be done, it’s simple layout has helped to make sure nothing was being missed whilst focusing on so many tasks in such a tight time frame. Learning to use Visual Code Studio was easy due to it’s simple layout and built in tools, it made the whole process a lot easier and let me focus on the code instead of having to figure out a new program on top of that, and a lot of the autofill functions within helped with inserting images and remembering to close off sections of the code correctly. </p>
    <p> I probably could’ve used a simpler method for the images as I had to do quite a bit of research due to this being completely new to me but I’m happy with the final outcome from GIMP. I’m happy with using personal pictures rather than just taking stock images as it feels more personal to me and I don’t need to take copyright into consideration.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3>
    <p>All the tools I used were designed specifically for the task at hand (i.e. Trello for planning, GIMP for image manipulation) so all of the tools I used were appropriate. I stuck with recommended programs that have been used in a variety of projects in the past to make sure they were fit for purpose and would also have the backup of other uses online whenever I needed help. By sticking with well known tools I avoided wasting time creating a project that wasn’t compatible or suitable. </p>

    <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3>
    <p>Overall, I’m quite happy with the final product, I tried to keep it simple so I knew it would be completed within the time frame, I think it looks quite elegant and all the information is set out clearly. The background image has worked well to show text without having to change colours too much unlike darker backgrounds.</p>
    <p>I added a new background to the About Me page to add some variety, I would’ve liked to have more of this throughout the different pages but I didn’t want to spend too much time editing pictures instead of working on the site itself, but I am happy with the layout and styling I’ve ended up with. Another feature I would’ve liked to add is buttons, I tried creating hexagonal buttons for the introduction but I couldn’t get them to look aesthetically pleasing on the page, buttons that matched the crocheted hexagon pattern would’ve made a nice addition. The final design looks exactly as I planned and I don’t feel like I’ve needed to sacrifice anything to finalise the project.</p>

    <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
    
    <p>With more time I probably would’ve added more complicated elements like videos or page transition effects, I would've liked to have all the units transition as if they're on one page that slides into the next. Also, I would’ve made the navigation a little more dynamic with buttons instead of just the navigation bar at the top. I would’ve created more backgrounds that gave variety but still stayed within the set theme.</p>
    <p>Overall, I wouldn’t change much on the site but maybe add a little more polish so it feels a bit more professional and clean.</p>

    <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
    <p>My site is designed to show all information clearly, I’ve checked that all required information is present and the formatting allows for it to be read clearly. I have logged all the information on parts that I’ve tried to implement but I wasn’t able to do, such as buttons, so there’s no work missed even if it’s not featured on the final site. The tools and programs I used to help develop the site were Trello, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Google Docs and GIMP which were all selected to fit a specific purpose based on recommendations so I’m happy that I didn’t need any other resources.</p>
