    <h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>


    <p>I spent some time researching similar personal websites so I could decide on a design I liked. The common theme with the ones I preferred was simplicity, keeping designs clean with little clutter and not overfilling each page. This gave me the idea of the intro page that was a very basic and brief intro instead of being bombarded with too much information at once. Originally I planned to keep all pages the same design but I think the About Me page needs a little more personality so this is the only page that’s not identical to the rest, though it’s not so different that it doesn’t fit in.</p>
    <p> I didn’t want to force all the questions on one page so I’ve split each unit onto its own page, keeping identical themes between them all so it flows better. The colour scheme is set to make it as easy to read as possible. Each question will be separated out into its own box so they’re clear with a slightly transparent background to show the details in the background image.
    <p>Pictures will only be featured on the about me page as I don’t feel they fit anywhere else, but I do want to add as much personality to that page as I can. I’ll be using square images to fill the space better and avoid contrasting orientation. The background will be an animated gif but something small in the corner to avoid distracting from the text as that’s the key feature on the site. The layout will be similar to the unit pages with boxes for each paragraph to stay on theme but there will be pictures in the boxes next to each paragraph.</p>
    <p>The references will be on their own page with the website title or any other info that may be needed, each page will link directly to the list instead of linking to the sites. Overall there won’t be too many pages, I want to keep everything simple and clean with little clutter.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>

    <p>Copyright issues can occur when any assets are used without permission, the best way to handle this would be to either ensure all permissions are confirmed before the work is done or by only using personal assets that don’t need permission
    Some assets may be claimed and will need to be removed, linking to sources is important.</p>

    <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them</h3>

    <p>There’s a variety of ways to make pages inclusive for those who may have issues accessing it due to disabilities; pictures should include alt text and in depth descriptions to help those with visual impairments, colour schemes should be used carefully to ensure the text is easy to read including changing sizes if needed or using colours that are still readable for people who are colourblind, videos should include captions, flashing images should be avoided in case they can cause seizures. It’s hard to make a site that’s fully accessible to everyone but it’s easy to set up in a way that makes it accessible to most people by keeping these things in mind. </p>

    <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h3>

    <p>There’s a range of file types that can be used on websites so it’s important to get the right one for the job. For example, common image types are JPEG, PNG or GIF but these are built up with pixels meaning resizing these can cause issues with the quality of the image, SVGs however are vectors so they’re built using proportional formulas, allowing resizing without losing any of the definition. This is better for logos, as photos cannot be created in this way. JPEGs are one of the most popular choices as they can contain over 16 million colours which can keep the details clearer in a high definition image, as well as being more flexible with compression to help the page load quicker. PNGs allow for transparency in the background but some browsers don’t support them. GIFs allow for basic animation which can allow for an animated logo or background etc. without the need to import a video file which would be larger and slower to load. A popular video format is .mp4 which allows for high quality playback and additional information such as subtitles</p>
    <p>HTML is used for basic websites and a whole site could be created using just a HTML file but for more freedom in adding customisation CSS files can be added, this can improve the content and allow for more customisation. </p>
