    <h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>


    <p>I spent some time researching similar personal websites so I could decide on a design I liked. The common theme with the ones I preferred was simplicity, keeping designs clean with little clutter and not overfilling each page. This gave me the idea of the intro page that was a very basic and brief intro instead of being bombarded with too much information at once. Originally I planned to keep all pages the same design but I think the About Me page needs a little more personality so this is the only page that’s not identical to the rest, though it’s not so different that it doesn’t fit in.</p>
    <p> I didn’t want to force all the questions on one page so I’ve split each unit onto its own page, keeping identical themes between them all so it flows better. The colour scheme is set to make it as easy to read as possible. Each question will be separated out into its own box so they’re clear with a slightly transparent background to show the details in the background image.
    <p>Pictures will only be featured on the about me page as I don’t feel they fit anywhere else, but I do want to add as much personality to that page as I can. I’ll be using square images to fill the space better and avoid contrasting orientation. The background will be an animated gif but something small in the corner to avoid distracting from the text as that’s the key feature on the site. The layout will be similar to the unit pages with boxes for each paragraph to stay on theme but there will be pictures in the boxes next to each paragraph.</p>
    <p>The references will be on their own page with the website title or any other info that may be needed, each page will link directly to the list instead of linking to the sites. Overall there won’t be too many pages, I want to keep everything simple and clean with little clutter.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>

    <p>Copyright issues can occur when any assets are used without permission, the best way to handle this would be to either ensure all permissions are confirmed before the work is done or by only using personal assets that don’t need permission
    Some assets may be claimed and will need to be removed, linking to sources is important.</p>

    <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them</h3>

    <p>There’s a variety of ways to make pages inclusive for those who may have issues accessing it due to disabilities; pictures should include alt text and in depth descriptions to help those with visual impairments, colour schemes should be used carefully to ensure the text is easy to read including changing sizes if needed or using colours that are still readable for people who are colourblind, videos should include captions, flashing images should be avoided in case they can cause seizures. It’s hard to make a site that’s fully accessible to everyone but it’s easy to set up in a way that makes it accessible to most people by keeping these things in mind. </p>

    <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>

    <p>I’ve always found the best way to test is by getting people who aren’t involved with the project to check through it, testing it personally works well but it doesn’t factor in for people using the product in unexpected ways. Sometimes when you test it yourself you fall into the trap of just following what you expect people to do whilst using it and therefore miss bugs and errors in parts where people try to do something different. It also gives an outside point of view to make sure it makes sense. A lot of tools such as Visual Studio Code and GitHub allow for the streamlining of debugging with in-built tools and giving access to others with more experience who can help with testing. I used VSC to help with checking my code as it highlights errors as they appear and uses colour coding to show that code is written properly, this saves time instead of having to go back over code at the end to add missing closing tags or brackets.</p>
    <p> When working on a much bigger project for public use a lot more needs to be taken into consideration, with more people involved there’s a higher need for clear communication but there’s a lot more options when working on large scale projects. Each step will use a different process in testing, such as unit testing to check the basic code is functioning properly, security testing to ensure everything is protected as it should be, or usability testing which checks the ease-of-use from the users perspective. Each step is important for ensuring the product doesn’t just work as a basic set of code but is also fit for purpose and accessible to the required audience.
