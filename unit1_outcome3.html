    <h1>Unit 1: Improving productivity with IT </h1>
    <h1>OUTCOME 3:</h1>

<div class="transparent">
    <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>
    <p>IT is everywhere and is incredibly useful for simplifying everyday tasks, improving accessibility for everyone and allowing rapid progress throughout many industries. It can help connect people, give access to so much that would normally be out of reach, and improve education as it allows for information to spread much faster. It lets companies save a lot of time and money by maintaining up to date tech to simplify processes and reduce errors.</p>
    <p>However it’s not perfect, as it develops there will still be issues remaining including bugs and errors. If a company relies too heavily on tech it can cause a lot of issues when systems break down, causing downtime which can cost a lot in the long term. Plus these systems need to be constantly maintained and updated to avoid issues. Being online a lot can also cause distractions during working hours, with some people having constant access to their phones or checking things online whenever they want, it can reduce productivity with people procrastinating online.</p>
    <p>I was pretty efficient in working on my site, I maintained the Trello board to keep track of what needed to be done and I used Google Docs so I could access the documents anywhere so I could work after hours when I felt I needed to. I also produced the less important aspects such as images in my spare time so I had more time to focus on the writing and coding which were new to me and needed more attention.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
    <p>Making plans and setting strict deadlines and reminders for each task helps to maintain focus and get everything completed on time, as well as ensuring enough time is available for every part required so goals are attainable. Ensuring breaks are taken regularly avoids fatigue and helps with focusing on one task until it’s done, it also reduces the need for distractions whilst working since you dedicate time to jobs outside of the project instead of having to try to work everything together. Improving communication can help with keeping productivity high as everyone knows exactly what they need to do and when it’s required and they don’t need to worry about other aspects when someone else is working on it. It’s important to keep maintain realistic expectations and not force multitasking which can distract from the end goal and cause mistakes, working towards a clear and attainable goal improves focus. </p>

    <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>
    <p>My main issue was focusing on one job when we started creating the website, I was trying to work on the text and the code at the same time and ended up a bit overwhelmed. Once I stepped back and managed specific time for each task, working with the Trello board to check for all steps, I was able to focus on what needed to be done to get each step completed before moving onto something else. Overall though I’m happy with the process I used, everything was completed in the time frame and I left myself enough time to check over all aspects of the work and to check on formatting for my writing.</p>

    <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>

    <p>I’ve always found the best way to test is by getting people who aren’t involved with the project to check through it, testing it personally works well but it doesn’t factor in for people using the product in unexpected ways. Sometimes when you test it yourself you fall into the trap of just following what you expect people to do whilst using it and therefore miss bugs and errors in parts where people try to do something different. It also gives an outside point of view to make sure it makes sense. A lot of tools such as Visual Studio Code and GitHub allow for the streamlining of debugging with in-built tools and giving access to others with more experience who can help with testing. I used VSC to help with checking my code as it highlights errors as they appear and uses colour coding to show that code is written properly, this saves time instead of having to go back over code at the end to add missing closing tags or brackets.</p>
    <p> When working on a much bigger project for public use a lot more needs to be taken into consideration, with more people involved there’s a higher need for clear communication but there’s a lot more options when working on large scale projects. Each step will use a different process in testing, such as unit testing to check the basic code is functioning properly, security testing to ensure everything is protected as it should be, or usability testing which checks the ease-of-use from the users perspective. Each step is important for ensuring the product doesn’t just work as a basic set of code but is also fit for purpose and accessible to the required audience.
