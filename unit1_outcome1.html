        <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business:</h3>

        <p>Technology is evolving constantly, if you want to be successful you have to keep up. Adapting to the new era of technology is key to surviving in such a competitive world, it can make or break an entire company. But it’s not just a weapon to keep you at the top, it provides so many tools to help ease the day-to-day, simplifying everyday tasks. </p>
        <p>Communication is one of the most important tools for a business, both internal and external, keeping in touch with customers or clients, increasing brand recognition, updating orders or pushing promotions. When dealing with a marketplace full of competitors it’s essential to get your name out there and stay relevant in the mind of the ever-changing and ultimately fickle audience, the easiest way to do this is with regular communication via email, as it’s a good way to push promotions, send updates and even just remind people of your company without being too intrusive.</p>
        <p>Knowing your audience has never been easier, with a myriad of tools like Google Analytics that let you view statistics showing exactly who is viewing what on a site. This helps businesses create content that will bring in more people to boost views or sales and also work on parts of the site that are less popular. This can help with forecasting and help improve stock control as the statistics are more accurate and easier to analyse. Utilizing SEO can help boost a company's audience and reputation by making the brand more recognizable. </p>
        <p>Stock control and procurement can be managed digitally to help avoid losses through accurate stock management, ensure orders are placed to replenish stock in time and to process orders in a simple way. Bespoke software can be created to help manage the specific needs of the company which can help streamline processes to reduce unnecessary paperwork. </p>
        <p>Automated systems can reduce costs and streamline processes by replacing people in stores and warehouses etc., reducing human error and allowing for a smaller headcount. This can help smaller companies thrive by allowing more work with less people and making processes simpler, giving them a bigger reach within the industry. </p>

        <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful?
        What tools? What skills?</h3>
        
        <p>When planning a project there’s a lot to consider before any work can be started, in order to ensure the final product will be exactly as required and working within the time frame an in depth plan should be made. If working on a group project communication is vital to ensure the correct work is being handled by the right people, issues are picked up early and fixed and everyone is on the same page for the final outcome. Managing expectations within the time frame can help reduce unnecessary work and make sure all the important aspects are completed, it may require negotiating with various people to either give more time or agree to remove certain elements in order to provide a completed product. Everything should be leading towards a clear goal.</p>
        <p>Using a planning tool like Trello can help by making it easy to visualise what’s left to be done and assign it to the relevant people as well on check on what’s already been completed. Research into the correct tools for the job can help avoid over complicating tasks, using a program designed for the task at hand can make it a lot easier as it can utilise skills developed by other people who’ve managed successful projects in the past.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website.
        How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.</h3>
        
        <p>By starting on Trello I’ve been able to make a step by step plan for the project to ensure I can keep track of my workload and ensure everything is checked before completion. I will start with planning the content in a text based form using HTML in Visual Studio Code to help flesh out the details and make a design plan on paper to get an idea of how the end product will look. I will use photo editing software to create personalised images for the background of my pages which will help finalise the final design and colour scheme, this will help me visualise the end product so I can plan what I need to add when I started developing it.</p>
        <p>I spent some time reseaching other peoples personal websites and it really helped shape my final design, seeing what I did and didn't like on other sites made it much easier to plan ahead, allowing time to work on personalised content instead of rushing last minute to add this in. I preferred the sleeker, cleaner sites rather than the ones clutteed with various columns and random images so I based my design on the idea of simplicity.</p>

        <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>
        
        <p>Poor planning can lead to key parts of the project not working how they should or just be missing entirely, a detailed plan of each step that needs to be taken and assigning people to each part can ensure that a project runs smoothly. 
        </p>
        <p>If too many people are assigned to work on one thing it can end up with confusing formatting and language styles from everyone having their own input without communicating properly. You can utilise online tools such as Google Docs or storing files on Trello so everything is automatically saved and can be easily accessed to everyone at any time, ensuring there’s no constraints on location. </p>
        <p>All time constraints should be taken into consideration early on so everything is planned with enough time for each part and there’s no unrealistic expectations of what can be done and when. Security should be in place to ensure it’s not accessible publicly so that no unauthorised changes can be made and no sensitive information is lost.</p>

        <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
            
            <p>Most required tasks will have some form of purpose-built software available that was designed specifically with that job in mind, and may have built in functions to help make things run smoother. It’s good to look at what’s popular within the industry and find recommended tools designed for a precise task though bespoke software could be developed to fulfill a very specific need, for example a graphic designer would be able to use Photoshop which is widely used in that field, whereas a factory may want a custom design MRO system that can track their stock and generate reports for purchasing. </p>
        <p>It’s also important to keep up to date as some older technology can be problematic and may not have the proper support behind it to ensure it works properly, this can cause problems with older systems crashing and losing functionality over time as well as losing data or leaving the systems vulnerable to malware. </p>

        <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.
        How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes
        version control</h3>
        
        <p>Using Trello to plan projects has helped in the past to keep track of all the steps in a project and make sure someone is assigned to the correct parts, ensuring there’s nothing missing from the final product and everything works together, including planning testing stages. This helped manage all work within a very strict deadline and split the work more evenly as well as being a good way to communicate what each person had done on that day, avoiding duplication of work. </p>
        <p>I’ve also used Slack as a way of centralising contact between multiple members of our team so we can keep in touch if work is being done out of hours or if anyone needs help whilst away from the group. This has helped when making last minute amendments to work or updating later on in the evening when I think of something that needs to be done instead of waiting for the morning when I might forget about it.</p>
        <p>Visual Code Studio is a great tool for writing the HTML as there’s a lot of built in functionality, such as autocompleting tags or simplifying adding images, which helps simplify the whole process and helps avoid errors with missing tags.</p>
        <p>I used a free photo editing software called GIMP to create personalised images for my website, this avoids issues with copyright but it also adds a more personal feel to the site and reflects my personality better. It has a variety of tools that helped me create a design from scratch and edit in any way I needed, including changing image hues, resizing shapes to fit into a grid and cutting down images. There’s a range of software I could’ve used so i researched the best for at home editing and this was the best free option I found. </p>
        <p>For this project I will only really be using GitHub to host the site at the end, this is an easy way to make the project public. </p>

        <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
        
        <p>Any data that is being used or received needs to be taken into account when planning projects to ensure that the GDPR guidelines are being met and that everything is handled securely. GDPR gives data subjects, such as users of online services, a greater degree of control over the processing of their data and the new guidelines, this allows users to access the information stored about them at anytime and request amendments or deletion when they want. This means companies must be storing data efficiently and safely to ensure this is possible as well as protecting users from malicious attacks. </p>
        <p>The idea is that less data is being stored just for the sake of it, data should be collected for a reason and held responsibly to reduce the risk to users. If companies fail to comply and then experience a data breach they will need to make all users aware which can ruin the image of the business.</p>
